# React Bookstore Project
Welcome to the React Bookstore project! This project is a simple web application that allows users to explore a collection of books fetched from an API. Users can search for specific books, view details about each book, and add, edit, or delete comments associated with each book.

# Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Bootstrap: A library that provides Bootstrap components as React components.
Redux: A state management library for JavaScript applications.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

# Usage
The homepage displays a list of books fetched from the API.
Use the search bar to find specific books by title or author.
Click on a book to view its details, including the comment section.
Add, edit, or delete comments associated with a book (only comments added by you can be edited or deleted).

# Redux Implementation
Redux is implemented in this project for learning purposes, even though the application's size may not necessitate its use. It helps understand how state management works in a larger-scale application.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to the project! Happy coding!
